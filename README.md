ðŸ§  Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard
End-to-End Dashboard Project using Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Power BI project is an end-to-end sales analysis dashboard that I created while exploring and learning the full Power BI ecosystem. The objective was to clean, model, and visualize complex sales data to derive actionable business insights using Power BIâ€™s robust capabilities.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used
-Power BI Desktop
-Power Query Editor
-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
-Data Modeling (Star Schema)
-Interactive Visualizations and Filters

ðŸ“Š Dataset & Tables Used
The data simulates a retail company's sales structure and includes multiple relational tables:
-Calendar Lookup
-Customer Lookup
-Category Lookup
-Product Lookup
-Product Subcategory Lookup
-Sales Data
-Returns Data
-Territory Lookup
-Category Sale

ðŸ”§ What I Did
1.Data Cleaning: Used Power Query Editor to clean and transform data â€” removed duplicates, handled null values, corrected data types.
2.Data Modeling: Designed a star schema with proper relationships among fact and dimension tables.
3.DAX Measures: Created custom measures like Total Sales, Profit Margin, Return Rate, Monthly Trends, etc.
4.Visualizations: Built interactive charts like bar graphs, donut charts, line graphs, map visuals, and slicers for enhanced user experience.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights Derived
1.Identified underperforming categories and subcategories based on sales and return data.
2.Compared regional performance using territory-wise data.
3.Analyzed customer trends over time using calendar mapping.
4.Derived profit and sales variance through custom DAX measures.
5.Cleaned and linked return data to understand how it impacts net sales.

ðŸ’¡ Learning & Experience
This was a self-initiated learning project. It gave me hands-on exposure to every core area of Power BI â€” from loading and cleaning raw datasets to creating meaningful, decision-driving dashboards. I experimented with advanced DAX functions, built a proper data model, and improved my understanding of how to turn complex data into insights.
